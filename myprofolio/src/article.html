            <p></p>Bacon, ham and sausages rank alongside <br>
            cigarettes as a major cause of cancer, the <br>
            World Health Organisation has said, placing cured <br>
            and processed meats in the same category as <br>
            asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco. <br>
            The report from the WHOâ€™s International Agency <br>
            for Research on Cancer said there was enough evidence to <br>
            rank processed meats as group 1 carcinogens because <br>
            of a causal link with bowel cancer. <br>
