        <p>Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork. <br>
        Bacon is prepared from several different cuts <br>
         of meat, typically from the pork belly or from <br>
          back cuts, which have less fat than the belly. It is <br>
          eaten on its own, as a side dish, or used as a minor <br>
           ingredient to flavour dishes</p>
