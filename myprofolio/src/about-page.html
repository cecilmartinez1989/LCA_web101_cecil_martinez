            <p>I Live in Lubbock most my life and graduated high school at  
            <br> Estacado HS. After high school I went into the Navy. I was <br>
            station in Yokosuka, Japan for 4 years. Went to, over 20 countries and saw
            <br> the half of the world twice. Then I came back to Lubbock <br>
            and wanted to be a cop, but found a love for computers more. I enrolled <br>    
             into college to start a major in computer science. It was going good in college until 
             <br> bills started to be hard to keep up with.I dropped out and started working full-time <br>
            and started getting promoted at my currrent job now. Currently I'm a student at the Lubbock <br>
            Coding Academy and love learning coding again.
